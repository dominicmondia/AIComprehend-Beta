It seems that the graduates of today are increasingly willing to go under the knife to get ahead of others when it comes to getting a job .\n\nOne girl told me that she was considering surgery to increase her height. \"They break your legs, put in special extending screws, and slowly expand the gap between the two ends of the bone as it re-grows, you can get at least 5 cm taller!\"\n\nAt that point, I was shocked. I am short, I can't deny that, but I don't think I would put myself through months of agony just to be a few centimetres taller. I don't even bother to wear shoes with thick soles, as I'm not trying to hide the fact that I am just not tall!\n\nIt seems to me that there is a trend towards wanting \"perfection\" , and that is an ideal that just does not exist in reality.\n\nNo one is born perfect, yet magazines, TV shows and movies present images of thin, tall, beautiful people as being the norm. Advertisements for slimming aids, beauty treatments and cosmetic surgery clinics fill the pages of newspapers, further creating an idea that \"perfection\" is a requirement, and that it must be purchased, no matter what the cost. In my opinion, skills, rather than appearance, should determine how successful a person is in his/her chosen career.",

As Christmas came nearer; her dream for a bike seemed to disappear; for she didn't mention it again.\n\nThen much to our surprise; on December 24th; she said that she really wanted a bike as the Christmas present more than anything else. We didn't know what to do. It was too late. We were busy with Christmas dinner and packing presents for our children; parents and also friends till midnight. So there was no time to buy the \"right bike\" for our little girl. Thinking that we might in this way make our child unhappy on Christmas; we felt _ and sad.\n\nSuddenly my husband came up with an idea. \"What if I make a little bike out of the clay   and write a note that she could trade in   the model bike for a real one after Christmas?\" So he spent the next 5 hours working on a small clay bike. On Christmas morning; we were very excited and waited for Mary to open the little box with the beautiful red and white bike and the note. She opened the box and read the note loudly. She looked at me and said; \"So; does this mean I can trade in this bike for a real one?\" Smiling; I said; \"yes.\"\n\nMary had tears in her eyes when she replied; \"I would never trade in this beautiful bike that Daddy made for me. I prefer to keep it rather than get a real one.\" At that moment; we thought we would have moved the god to buy her every bike on earth.",

        "passage": "Kindergartens may teach you very important things you need to know. Dancy, a 5-year-old boy, saved his father's life with the skills he learned.\n\nThe boy's father became seriously ill on the way home from a father-son shopping. He couldn't speak and could hardly move, but he tried hard to stop the car safely. At that point, Dancy used his father's phone to call his mother for help. The 5-year-old boy tried his best to give her useful information and he was able to tell where they were. Just as he had learned in the kindergarten, Dancy read the letters he saw on a nearby store sign: \"F,U,R,N,I,T,U,R,E.\" But that wasn't enough for his mother to find them. Then he added that they were near a bridge. Finally, his mother understood he was talking about a store called Furniture 22 on New Jersey's Route 22. The mother called 911 and the father was saved in time.\n\n\"He just thought his dad needed help,\" Dancy's mother told the reporter. She also pointed out that her husband was a hero, too. \"It is surprising for him to get off the highway and get himself and his child to safety even when he was so sick,\" she said.\n\nShine, head of the kindergarten, felt proud of his pupil. \"Dancy's spelling skills helped him seize the moment,\" he said. \"And that's the real value of education.\"",
